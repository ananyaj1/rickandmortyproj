# Rick's Crystal Ball

This is a ReactJS project based on the TV show Rick and Morty. The application should figure out the current location of a selected 
character in the multiverse. Uses Rick and Morty API. 

Practice using React hooks, state, & making API calls. 

**DISCLAIMER: This project is just for fun and for me to practice web-dev skills. I do not own any of the characters.
