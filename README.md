Rick's Crystal Ball

This is a ReactJS project based on the TV show Rick and Morty. The application should figure out the current location of a selected 
character in the multiverse. Uses Rick and Morty API. 

Recently Completed: 
- Basic UI

TODO:
- Add hardcoded character cards
- Return character data to the cards
- Return location information from API endpoint.

**DISCLAIMER: This project is just for fun and for me to practice web-dev skills. I do not own any of the characters.
